/**
 * Java programs (and most of the other languages) have keywords. Each has an
 * specific meaning and sometimes they need to be used in a specific order.
 *
 * You write java programs by following a specific set of rules, using a combination of these
 * keywords and other things you will see which collectively form a java program.
 *
 * NOTE: keywords are case sensitive - public and Public and even PUBLIC are different things.
 *
 * "public" and "class" are two java keywords. They have an specific meaning that we'll find out
 * more about moving forward.
 *
 * the "public" java keyword is an access modifier - that allows us to define the scope or how other
 * parts of your code or even some else's code can access this code.
 *
 * So far, we'll use the public access modifier to give full access. We'll come back to access modifier later.
 *
 * Defining a "class". The class keyword is used  to define a class with the name of following the keyword.
 * Hello in this case and left and right curly braces to define the class block.
 *
 * to define a class requires an optional access modifier, followed by class, followed by the left and right curly braces.
 * The left and right curly braces are defining the class body - anything in between them is 'part' of this class.
 * We can have data and code as you will see as we progress.
 * So that's our first class defined.
